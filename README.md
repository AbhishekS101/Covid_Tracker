# Covid_Tracker
With this tool you can get the latest updates on the cases of Covid19 for any country.
For this we have used the [covid module](https://pypi.org/project/covid/) created recently by Ahmed Nafeis which provides regarding the novel corona virus provided by Johns Hopkins university and worldometers.info.
And for the gui we have Tkinter module.
